In collaboration with the [crfm-helm](https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm/) team, we are trying out some new ways to structure the code base. Our goal is to look at options to improve the architecture while preserving the strengths of HELM, so that we can enable the [MLCommons AI Safety](https://mlcommons.org/working-groups/ai-safety/ai-safety/) project. Everything, especially the name, is provisional.
