# Tutorial

To help illustrate the concepts of ModelGauge, we provide a series of functional (if silly) examples in the `demo_plugin` folder. These tutorials walks through those examples.

* The [Test Tutorial](tutorial_tests.md) walks through `demo_plugin/tests`.
* [System Under Test (SUT) Tutorial](tutorial_suts.md) walks through `demo_plugin/suts`.
* If you are ready to start making your own Test or SUT, you can jump straight to [how plugins work](plugins.md).
